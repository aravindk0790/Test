Subject: Urgent: Assistance Needed with Migration-Django Pod Authentication Issue

Hi Tom,

I hope this email finds you well. I require some assistance from the Zimperium team regarding an issue we are currently facing. It appears that the migration-django pod has encountered a failure due to password authentication. Strangely, all other services have been deployed successfully, and the problem seems to be isolated to the migration-django service. Unfortunately, I'm unsure as to why this particular service is causing the problem.

Could you kindly arrange a Teams meeting with the Zimperium team at your earliest convenience? I believe it would greatly help us to have a discussion and walk through the issue together. I appreciate your support in resolving this matter promptly.

Thank you,

[Your Name]
