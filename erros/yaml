    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        Â· The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what
            can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be
            supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster
            to have an effect.
    [OK] Pod Probes
        Â· Container is missing a livenessProbe
            A livenessProbe can be used to restart the container if it's
            deadlocked or has crashed without exiting. It's only recommended to
            setup a livenessProbe if you really need one.
