Message and Grammar Check:

"I am unable to log in to ukpre1 PaaS from CyberArk. It was working fine before, and we deployed a few services. However, since yesterday, I have been unable to log in to the new PaaS via CyberArk. I'm receiving the following error message. Could you please advise on this issue? It has blocked the OHE3 migration in the pre-environment."

Note: I made a few modifications to improve the grammar and clarity of the message.
